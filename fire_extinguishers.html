                <p>A water extinguisher is for use on Class A fires, meaning those involving wood, paper, plastics,
                    coal
                    and
                    fabrics. Sometimes known as freely burning materials, on no account whatsoever should water
                    extinguishers be
                    used for firefighting where live electrical equipment or flammable liquids are involved.

                    Water fire extinguishers are colour coded with a red label. Do not be confused with the normal
                    red
                    paint
                    finish on the main body of most types of fire extinguishers. The fire extinguisher works by
                    water under pressure cooling burning material.</p><br><br>

                <p>Water Plus with Additive fire extinguishers can be used to tackle Class A fires involving solid
                    combustible
                    materials such as wood, paper, plastics, coal and fabrics, they are ideally suited for use in
                    warehouses,
                    storage units and offices.

                    Water with an additive the fire extinguisher can provide effective fire protection but it is
                    important
                    to
                    remember not to use the extinguisher on electrical fires. Water particles conduct electricity and so
                    can
                    cause harm to the operator if used on electrical appliances however the Hydrospray nozzle of the
                    water
                    additive extinguisher ensures wide and accurate delivery of extinguishing fluid and is tested to
                    35KV
                    conductivity, keeping you safe if accidentally sprayed onto live electrical equipment.

                    It is common to pair up a water fire extinguisher with a CO2 extinguisher to create all-around
                    protection.

                <p>Foam or AFFF (Aqueous Film Forming Foam) fire extinguishers are more versatile than water and are
                    lighter
                    in
                    weight compared with water equivalents delivering similar suppressant performance. Foam fire
                    extinguishers
                    can be used for Class A fires, those involving wood, paper, plastics, coal and fabrics as well as
                    Class
                    B
                    fires involving flammable liquids such as petrol, turpentine or paint. However, they are not
                    recommended
                    for
                    fires involving electricity unless the electrical current can be disconnected first.

                    Foam fire extinguishers are colour coded with a cream label and discharges a foam solution under
                    pressure
                    that forms a blanket or film on the surface of a burning liquid creating a barrier between the fire
                    vapours
                    and the air necessary to support combustion thereby smothering the fire.</p>

                <p>A Carbon Dioxide (CO2) fire extinguisher is ideal for fires involving live electrical equipment and
                    Class
                    B
                    fires such as flammable liquids e.g. petrol. They do not work by cooling the fire and therefore not
                    recommended for controlling Class A fires involving wood, paper, plastics, coal and fabrics. CO2
                    fire
                    extinguishers are colour coded with a black label.

                    CO2 extinguishers discharge gas under pressure replacing the air with inert Carbon Dioxide gas which
                    does
                    not support combustion and because CO2 extinguishers contain no water and leave no residue they are
                    safe
                    to
                    use on sensitive electrical equipment. However, carbon dioxide is a gas and can asphyxiate if
                    inhaled so
                    care should be taken when using in a confined space. During discharge, the horn becomes extremely
                    cold
                    most
                    new CO2 extinguishers are fitted with a double insulated horn to prevent cold burns if handled
                    making
                    them
                    easier and safer to use but caution should be exercised.</p>

                <p>ABC Dry Powder fire extinguishers are extremely versatile and can be used on Class A fires, e.g.
                    wood,
                    paper,
                    plastics, coal and fabrics, Class B fires involving flammable liquids, e.g. petrol, turpentine or
                    paint,
                    and
                    Class C fires involving flammable gases, e.g. hydrogen, butane or methane and live electrical fires,
                    however, if the fire involves computers, the powder residue may damage the equipment.

                    Dry Powder fire extinguishers can be used in environments containing mixed fire risks e.g.
                    factories,
                    garages/workshops and vehicles. However, there is a risk of inhalation when using powder
                    extinguishers
                    indoors, they are not recommended for use within small rooms or where exit routes could be hidden
                    due to
                    poor visibility when discharged. Dry Powder fire extinguishers are colour coded with a blue label.

                    In addition to ABC Dry Powder extinguishers, there are specialist Powder Extinguishers which are
                    designed to
                    tackle fires involving combustible metals such as lithium, magnesium, sodium or aluminium when in

                    form
                    of swarf or powder. There are three special powders based on graphite, copper and sodium chloride.

                    alt="Wet Chemical Fire Extinguishers">
                <p>Wet Chemical Extinguishers are suitable for use on Class A fires meaning those involving wood, paper,
                    plastics, coal and fabrics and ideal for Class F fires typically cooking oils e.g. deep fat fryers
                    or
                    chip-pan fires. Other types of extinguishers such as Water, Foam, Powder and CO2 will not always put
                    out
                    cooking oil fires and are also extremely dangerous because the pressure of these extinguishers can
                    cause
                    the
                    oil to jet out and cause serious harm.

                    Wet Chemical Extinguishers are easily identifiable by the yellow label and are applied using the
                    extended
                    applicator in slow circular movements, which gives a gentle, yet highly effective fine mist or spray
                    onto
                    the burning fat until the surface of the burning cooking oil changes into a soapy-like substance
                    which
                    prevents re-ignition. The gentle application helps to prevent burning oil splashing out of the
                    container.

                    The solution provides a similar blanketing effect to a foam extinguisher, but with a greater cooling
                    effect.
                    The saponification only works on animal fats and vegetable oils, so most Class F extinguishers
                    cannot be
                    used for Class B fires involving flammable liquids, e.g. petrol, turpentine or paint. The misting
                    also
                    helps
                    to prevent splashing the blazing oil.</p>

                    alt="MultiCHEM Fire Extinguishers">
                <p>The MultiCHEM extinguisher from CommanderEDGE is a groundbreaking and innovative fire extinguisher.
                    The
                    MultiCHEM is a multi-class fire extinguisher which are not newcomers to the market however the
                    MultiCHEM
                    offers a new solution.

                    The MultiCHEM extinguisher is a high-performance ABF rated extinguisher and with the 34A rating
                    gives
                    the
                    industry’s highest available A rating for a 6-litre extinguisher. The 34A rating means that if an
                    untrained
                    person uses the MultiCHEM they can tackle a large fire. Also, the 233B rating gives an unrivaled
                    efficiency
                    to tackle a flammable liquid fire which involves large amounts of fuel and a big surface area,
                    Finally,
                    the
                    75F rating enables the extinguisher to be used on Class F fires typically cooking oils e.g. deep fat
                    fryers
                    or chip-pan fires.

                    MultiCHEM fire extinguishers can be used for Class A fires, those involving wood, paper, plastics,
                    coal
                    and
                    fabrics as well as Class B fires involving flammable liquids such as petrol, turpentine or paint.
                    The
                    MultiCHEM extinguisher has also passed the 35kVa Dielectric test which makes it safe if accidentally
                    sprayed
                    onto live electrical equipment. No other extinguisher gives this level of safety to staff and the
                    public
                    with the MultiCHEM extinguisher is compact and easy to handle, so it’s almost impossible to make a
                    mistake.
